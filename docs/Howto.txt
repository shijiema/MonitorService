Besides unit tests and integration tests developed, this service
can also be tested manualy by using telnet. if you do not have
telnet installed, try alternative utility such as nc instead.

On windows 7 and above, telnet is not installed by default. You
can go to control panel to enable windows feature to get it installed.

How to start the service

Please go to misc folder and execute startMonitorService.bat

How to test using telnet

1.you can open two or more telnet sessions from different command line windows or from
two computures. To connect to Monitor Service, start telnet as this:
	telnet localhost 7777
If connection is successful, the Monitor Service will send telnet a list of service you
can subscribe. Sorry that I did not have enough time to give the clients a warm welcome :)

2. Refer to the command samples listed in SampleCommands.txt and try to interact with Monitor Service.
For example, if you want to subscribe a service called gWeb, and a service called GRWeb, you can issue 
a command like this:
		subscrine:
		gWeb
		GRWeb
		.end.
Note, there's not leading spaces when you enter them.
		
"subscribe:" is a command for client to subscribe services. "gWeb" is the name of service. You can
specify more services to subscribe. Each service will occupy one line. You end the subscribe command
by providing a terminater called ".end.".

3. In second window, you can subscribe some services with some of them in common with the services
subscribed by first client

4. You can then adjust polling frequency by issuing polling period command in one or both clients and
observe the change on update frequency. Time unit is second.

	set polling:
	20
	.end.
This means for the services subscribed, this subscriber wants to be notified every 20 seconds. Notification
frequency is impacted by grace period and planned outage period too.

5. to shutdown the service, do this:
	shutdown:
